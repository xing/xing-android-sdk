Add all the power of the XING platform to your app.

This library provides a java implementation of a network layer infrastructure required to access the XING Web Services. 
It's center class the `XingApi` allows users to access resources that reflect the XING API public, documentation for 
which can be found [here](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources).

How to get Started
==========

### 1.1. For Java projects

Add the XING API Client as a dependency:

Either through Gradle:

```gradle
compile 'com.xing.api:api-client:x.y.z'
```
or by using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.xing.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>api-client</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

### 1.2. For Android projects

For Android we made an additional step and implemented an oauth helper library, to simplify **Login with XING** 
implementation in your app. To benefit from this library just add the following dependency in you gradle build file:

```gradle
compile 'com.xing.api:android-oauth:x.y.z'
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/xing/api/).

### 2. Add OAuth credentials to your project

Add your **OAuth Consumer Key** and **OAuth Consumer Secret** to your project.

The OAuth information can be obtained after registering a new app on <https://dev.xing.com/applications>

#### For Android projects you can add the keys to your *local.properties* file: 

```
	oauth_consumer_secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	oauth_consumer_key=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
	sdk.dir=/path/to/sdk
```

You are also free to provide this information in any other way. For example using *Preferences* or a helper class 
containing the API credentials as CONSTANTS.

### 3. Build your first app (Android Example)

To build your Android app with the XING API Client check out the [Get started page](GETTING_STARTED_ANDROID.md)

Based on Okio
==========

The XING API Client is fully based on the [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio) stack. We use 
[OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) for networking, [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) for Json parsing,
and the request building/execution system is a fork of [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit).

Borrows from Retrofit
==========

If you are using [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) as an HTTP client, you will find this api to be very 
familiar. <br>
Here are somme key differences and similarities are:

* `XingApi` - This class acts as a key entry point and *resource* provider (Similar to `Retrofit` in Retrofit 2.)
* `Resource` - Namespace/Api provider class. We try to reflect the public [api documentation](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources)
in such a way that every *resource* section will have it's own `Resource` class implementation.
* `CallSpec<RT, ET>` - Similar to `Call<T>` in Retrofit, but with a few key deference's:
  - `CallSpec` is aware of both return types `RT` for success and `ET` for error responses. And will parse them out 
  of the box.
  - `CallSpec` allows users to alter the underlying request to a certain degree (you can add query or form params, as
   well as completely change the request body. This will become useful for those who want to benefit form optional 
   request parameters accepted by XING WEB Services.
  - In addition to `#execute()` and `#enqueue()` methods `CallSpec` provides `#stream()` and `#rawStream()` if you are
   into RxJava (**WARNING:** usage of these methods will require you to have RxJava in your classpath).
