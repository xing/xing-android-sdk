# XING Android SDK
---

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xing/xing-android-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xing/xing-android-sdk)

Add all the power of the XING platform to your Android app using the XING Android SDK.

This library provides an Android implementation of the network layer infrastructure required to access
the XING Web Services. Basically this SDK provides a standalone RequestExecutor, Module, Tasks and requests, which reflect the public XING API which can be found [here](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources).

## DISCLAIMER

__Curently version 2.0 is under heavy development. This version may change/deprecate some API's currently present in the library. For more information please checkout the [github issues page](https://github.com/xing/xing-android-sdk/issues).__

#### Currently the following resources are available as Tasks in the XING Android SDK:

- [User Profiles](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources#user-profiles)
- [Contacts](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources#contacts)
- [Profile Visits](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources#profile-visits)
- [Contact Requests](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources#contact-requests)
- [Contact Path](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources#contact-path)


How to get Started
==========

## 1. Add the SDK to your project

Add the SDK as a dependency:

Either through Gradle:

```gradle
compile 'com.xing.android:sdk:1.0.1'
```
or by using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.xing.android</groupId>
  <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/xing/android/sdk/).

## 2. Add OAuth credentials to your project

Add your **OAuth Consumer Key** and **OAuth Consumer Secret** to your *local.properties* file.

The OAuth information can be obtained after registering a new app on <https://dev.xing.com/applications>

The file should then look something like this:

**local.properties**

```java
	oauth_consumer_secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	oauth_consumer_key=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
	sdk.dir=zzz
```

You are also free to provide this information in any other way. For example using *Preferences* or a helper class containing the OAuth credentials in CONSTANTS.
